How to run the programs
________________________

Before running the program, please ensure you have Java SE Development Kit installed.

Using IDEs:
All the files are ready to run on an integrated development environment(IDE).
Each file contains a scanner object which allows users to enter an input in the terminal.
The function will run automatically to compute the answer.

Using command line:
Open the command prompt window and use the 'cd' command to navigate to the directory which contains the Java files. Assuming the files are in an "src" folder:
>> $ cd src/

Type the command line below to compile the code into a class file:
>> $ javac {file-name.java}
example: $ javac Initials.java

Press enter to compile the code. The command prompt will move to the next line.

Type the command line below to run the program:
>> $ java {file-name}
example: $ java Initials

Press enter and the program will start running, prompting the user to enter an input.
